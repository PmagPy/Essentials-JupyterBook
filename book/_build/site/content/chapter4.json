In later chapters, we will be concerned with the magnetization of these assemblages, but here we continue our investigation of the behavior of individual particles.\nIn Chapter 3, we learned that in some crystals electronic spins work in concert to create a spontaneous magnetization that remains in the absence of an external field. The basis of paleomagnetism is that these ferromagnetic particles carry the record of ancient magnetic fields. What allows the magnetic moments to come into equilibrium with the geomagnetic field and then what fixes that equilibrium magnetization into the rock so that we may measure it millions or even billions of years later? We will begin to answer these questions over the next few chapters.","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"key":"FMe02IftLZ"}],"key":"uTl9s9p8cM"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1},"end":{"line":14,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We will start with the second part of the question: what fixes magnetizations in particular directions? A basic principle is that ferromagnetic particles have various contributions to the magnetic energy which controls their magnetization. No matter how simple or complex the combination of energies may become, the grain will seek the configuration of magnetization which minimizes its total energy. The short answer to our question is that certain directions within magnetic crystals are at lower energy than others. To shift the magnetization from one “easy” direction to another requires energy. If the barrier is high enough, the particle will stay magnetized in the same direction for a very long time—say, billions of years. In this chapter, we will address the causes and some of the consequences of these energy barriers for the magnetization of rocks. Note that in this chapter we will be dealing primarily with energy densities (volume normalized energies) as opposed to energy.

It is worth pointing out however, that the size at which domain walls appear in magnetite is poorly constrained because it depends critically on the exact shape of the particle, its state of stress and even its history of exposure to past fields. Estimates in the literature range from as small as 20 nm to much larger (up to 100 nm) depending on how the estimates are made. Nonetheless, it is probably true that truly single domain magnetite is quite rare in nature, yet more complicated states are difficult to treat theoretically.
