# Essentials of Paleomagnetism

The geomagnetic field acts as both a shield, protecting Earth's surface from cosmic radiation, and a window, giving insight into the dynamics of the deep Earth. Rocks and sediments can record the ambient magnetic field, with these records having the potential to persist for millions to billions of years. They reveal a history of the geodynamo including geomagnetic reversals and document the changing paleogeography of Earth through deep time. Extracting such information requires an understanding of rock magnetism and paleomagnetism, the subjects of this book.

This textbook draws together essential rock magnetic theory, paleomagnetic techniques, and applications from magnetostratigraphy to tectonic reconstructions. It is intended for Earth scientists who use paleomagnetic data, students in courses with paleomagnetic content, and anyone with a college-level science background curious about records of Earth's magnetism.

## About This Edition

The original edition of this book was written by Lisa Tauxe with contributions from R.F. Butler, S.K. Banerjee, and R. van der Voo. With Lisa's blessing, Nick Swanson-Hysell is porting, revising, and updating the text into an interactive web book format. This version includes 3D visualizations and figures including those developed through integrated code that draws on [PmagPy](https://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy-docs/intro.html). Chapters are being revised on a rolling basis. Chapters that are solely ported from the previous edition have Lisa listed as the sole author. When substantive additions and revisions have been made by Nick, both are listed as chapter authors.

The previous edition of Essentials of Paleomagnetism is available at [EarthRef.org](https://earthref.org/MagIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/) and the source files for that edition are on [GitHub](https://github.com/ltauxe/Essentials-of-Paleomagnetism).
